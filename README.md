# TCMotorfest.Unpacker

Unpacks files from The Crew Motorfest's `.toc`/`.bfd` big files.

**No keys or binaries are currently included for obvious reasons, therefore this is not in a currently usable state and will stay this way for now. This should be used as a reference for the time being.**

### TODOs

* Scalett: Read FileBlockTables (.fbt) (not needed for extraction)
* Use chunked buffering when reading rather than read inputs in one go
